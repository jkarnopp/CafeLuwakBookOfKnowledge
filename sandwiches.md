##  Sandwich Details

**AVOCADOS** should always be sliced about 1/8” to ¼” and never spread on the sandwich. Standard portion is ¼ of an avocado unless the avocado is really small or it is going on the \#25. The slices are very important because in one of our reviews, the reviewer specifically mentioned how the slices were unique and made the sandwich taste better.

**Portabellas** – Should always be sliced and the standard portion is ½ of a mushroom unless they are really small or on the \#24 where the mushroom is the main ingredient.

Multiple meat sandwiches always have ½ portions of meat.

Children’s **Turkey Triangle** has ½ Portion of meat.

**Dressings** should always be spread evenly across the entire slice of bread. There should be approximately 1 ounce per side, so you want the bread to be evenly covered where you can’t see the pours in the bread, but you don’t want the dressing to drip off.

**Russian in Spicy Mustard** should be mixed together on each side of the Rueben’s. The spicy aspect of the mustard neutralizes the sweetness of the Russian when they are mixed. If you put them on opposite sides of the sandwich you will taste sweet and spicy as separate parts of the sandwich and it will ruin the effect.

**Cheese** should be on both sides of the sandwich except where mentioned below.

**Bread should be sliced ½ to 5/8 of an inch thick. If the bread is too thick you will not be able to enjoy the ingredients of the sandwich.**

**BALANCE** – All of the ingredients of the sandwich should be spread out evenly so the sandwich is uniform. In food service presentation is as important as quality. 

**\#2 – Tom’s Choice** Gets **SMOKED TURKEY**.

**\#7, \#23, and \#59 Rueben’s:** get Mustard and Russian mixed together on both sides of the bread.

**\#7, \#23, and \#59 Rueben’s:** the Kraut should be spread out evenly over the meat, not piled in the center.

**\#23 - Judies Rueben:** Has swiss on the bottom, then tempeh, then kraut, then tomatoes, then deli dust. The tomatoes should not be in between the kraut and the tempeh. The swiss compliments the tempeh, and the cheddar goes with the dusted tomatoes, so the order is very important on this sandwich.

**\#24 - Best of Everything:** get a whole mushroom sliced into strips.

**\#25 – Heartbreak:** get 1/2 an avocado – **Sliced not Spread!**

**\#20 - Old English:** has cream cheese on one side and honey mustard on the other.

**\#27 – Garden Delight:** has Cream Cheese on one side and Swiss on the other. Lettuces goes on the cream cheese side.

**\#29 – Mama Mia Sub:** Gets a full portion of ham, so 2 Half Portions since the ham is portioned in half by default.

**\#32 – Out Limits Sub:** gets half portions for all three meats.

**\#42 – Sheila B:** Gets **SMOKEDTURKEY**

**\#42, \#43, and \#44 – Wraps:** The Cream Cheese should be spread around the edge, so when the sandwich is rolled up the cheese acts like a glue to hold it together.

**\#61 – BBQ Beef:** has BBQ sauce on the bun and BBQ sauce mixed in with the meat after it is warmed. The meat should look wet with barbeque sauce.
