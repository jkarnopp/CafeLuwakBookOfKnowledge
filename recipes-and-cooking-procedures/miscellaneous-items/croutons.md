# Croutons

  
**Ingredients**  
2 Loaves of bread \(Challah, Wheat, Italian\)  
2 1/2 lbs. of lightly salted butter \(not margarine\)  
2 1/2 Tablespoons McCormick cajun seasoning \(closest to outback seasoning\)  
3/4 cup of finely chopped fresh garlic

Pre heat oven to 250-275

Cut bread into bite size pieces \(1 inch cubes\)

melt butter until it looks like mayo \(do not melt to a liquid\)

add garlic and seasoning to butter \(set aside\)

Put bread on cookie sheet and toast bread until they are golden brown, this will take about 20 min or less depending on your oven. Watch them!

When bread has toasted to a golden brown take out of oven and let cool \(do not try and coat croutons when warm or they will not come out right\)

When croutons have cooled place butter mixture in a large bowl \(you might have to soften butter mixture again, thats ok, but remember not to a liquid\)

Add croutons to butter mixture and coat each crouton gently using your hands \(you might want to use plastic gloves\) Make sure that the garlic is staying on the croutons. If you need more butter go ahead add a little more. One important thing you need to make sure that you do not overdo on the butter or they will burn and get soggy.

Put croutons back on cookie sheet and bake for 8 to 10 min. Gently shake the pan to make sure they are all browning correctly. Do not over shake though, garlic might come off the croutons
