# Mocha Espresso Shake

Add three kiddie scoops of vanilla Ice Cream to a metal shake cup.

Pump two squirts of Mocha Syrup in the metal shake cup.

Brew two shots of espresso and pour into the metal shake cup.

Add a splash of milk.

Mix until the shake is smooth.

Since the espresso is hot and melts the ice cream this shake will be a little thinner than a normal shake. Very little if any milk is needed otherwise the shake will be too thin.
