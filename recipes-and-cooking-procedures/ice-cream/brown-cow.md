# Brown Cow

Add three kiddie-sized scoops of vanilla Ice Cream to the metal shake cups.

Add Root Beer until the cup is about ¾ full.

Mix until the shake is a smooth constancy.

This drink will be a little thinner than a normal shake because of the root beer,  but it should still be relatively thick.
