# Milkshake

Milkshakes are one size and should be served in a 16oz cup.

Add three kiddie-sized scoops to the metal shake cups.

Add milk until the cup is about Â¾ full.

Mix until the shake is a smooth constancy.

Shake should be thick when it is poured into the cup.

Shakes for here should be served in the glass shake cup along with the extra in the metal cup. The glass cups are only 12 oz, so there should be 4 oz left in the mixing cup when served.
