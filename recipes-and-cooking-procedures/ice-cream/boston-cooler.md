# Boston Cooler

Add three kiddie-sized scoops of vanilla Ice Cream to the metal shake cups.

Add Vernors until the cup is about Â¾ full.

Mix until the shake is a smooth constancy.

This drink will be a little thinner than a normal shake because of the Vernors,  but it should still be relatively thick.
