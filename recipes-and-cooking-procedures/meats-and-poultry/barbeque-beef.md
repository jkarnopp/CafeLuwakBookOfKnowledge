# Barbeque Beef

  
Place brisket in a 2” hotel pan with a roasting rack.

Cover both sides completely with brisket rub.

Place in oven on 275 for 2 hours.

Remove from oven and place brisket in a sheet of foil and fold the sides up so it can hold liquid.

Pour 1 bottle of beer over the brisket.

Wrap the brisket 2 times in foil making sure the beer doesn’t leak out.

Place back in the oven on 275 for 8 to 10 hours. \(approximately an hour per pound\)

Place the pan on the cooling rack in the walk-in and set a timer for **two** hours.

When the timer goes off, temp the meat and make sure it is below **70** degrees and record the value in the temperature log.

Now set the timer for **Four** hours and temp the meat again to make sure it is below **41** degrees and record the value in the temperature log.
