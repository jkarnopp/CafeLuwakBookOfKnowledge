# Roast Beef Cooking Procedure

  
Preheat oven to **450**

Coat Roast Beef with Deli Dust and Granulated Garlic. \(Especially heavy on the fatty area\) Meat gets its flavor from the fat soaking into the muscle.

Fill the bottom of the pan with ½ inch of water with a grate in the bottom and place the meat in fat side facing up.

Cook beef for **45** Minutes

Turn oven down to **225**

Set timer for **Two** hours

**Check temp:** if less than **130** set a timer for **20** minutes and repeat this step.

Meat increases in temperature faster as it cooks. So once it gets over 100 degrees it is extremely important to watch it carefully. Always temp the meat. This is the law as defined by the health code and it is extremely dangerous to serve meat that hasn’t been cooked properly.

**NEVER** try to set a timer to when it should be finished. Meat cooks at different rates depending on how much it weighs, the relative humidity, ambient temperature, and so on. Always set the timer and keep checking the temp till it is done. You should have to check it several times before it is ready.

**ALWAYS TEMP MEAT** in the thickest part of the meat and in at least four places for the roast beef.

Once the meat is finished cooking, trim the fat and gristle. You want to do this while the meat is still warm because the fat will pull away from the meat quite a bit easier than when it is cold. When the meat is cold you will usually have to trim the fat, and you will end up cutting a lot of meat away too.

Once trimmed, cut the meat into at least four pieces and Place the pan on the cooling rack in the walk-in, and set a timer for **two** hours.

When the timer goes off, temp the meat and make sure it is below **70** degrees and record the value in the temperature log.

Now set the timer for **Four** hours and temp the meat again to make sure it is below **41** degrees and record the value in the temperature log.
