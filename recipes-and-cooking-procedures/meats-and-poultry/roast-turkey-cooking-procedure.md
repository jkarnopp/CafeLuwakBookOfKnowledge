# Roast Turkey Cooking Procedure

  
Preheat oven to **350**

Remove turkey breast from the bone. Do this by making shallow cuts angled against the breastbone and pealing the meat away. You should not see any meat on the top side of the bone when you are done. The meat we use for soup and turkey salad should come mostly from the trimmings and back section of the breast.

Once you have deboned the breast rub in olive oil, paprika, and deli dust on both sides of the meat.

Next, wrap the meat in tin foil and place in a hotel pan with ½ in of water in the bottom and place in oven.

Set timer for **Two** hours

**Check temp:** if less than **165** set timer for **20** minutes and repeat this step.

Meat increases in temperature faster as it cooks. So once it gets over 130 degrees it is extremely important to watch it carefully. Always temp the meat. This is the law as defined by the health code and it is extremely dangerous to serve meat that hasn’t been cooked properly.

**NEVER** try to set a timer to when it should be finished. Meat cooks at different rates depending on how much it weighs, the relative humidity, ambient temperature, and so on. Always set the timer and keep checking the temp till it is done. You should have to check it several times before it is ready.

**ALWAYS TEMP MEAT** in the thickest part of the meat and in at least three places for the roast turkey.

Cut the meat into two pieces and Place the pan on the cooling rack in the walk-in and set a timer for **Two** hours.

When the timer goes off, temp the meat and make sure it is below **70** degrees and record the value in the temperature log.

Now set the timer for **Four** hours and temp the meat again to make sure it is below **41** degrees and record the value in the temperature log.
