# Corned Beef Cooking Procedure

Place corned beef in a 6-inch hotel pan with a grate on the bottom and the meat with the fat side up.

Sprinkle the top of the meat liberally with pickling spice.

Fill the bottom of the pan with water until it ½ inch above the meat.

Cover Pan with Tin Foil poking a single hole in each end.

Place pan across two burners and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn burners down and let simmer for 1.5 hours \(use a timer\).

When the timer goes off, place the pan in the oven on 300 for two more hours.

This is one of the only meats that can be cooked with a  timer. It is still a good idea to temp it, but it should be well over 180 degrees.

When the meat finishes cooking pull it out of the oven and transfer it to a 2-inch hotel pan with a grate in the bottom.

Using two pairs of tongs, scrape the fat from the top of the meat and in between the butt end. This will be much easier when the meat is still warm and the fat will scrap away. A little fat left behind is okay as long as it is under ¼ inch.

Next cut off the butt end and then cut the remaining piece of brisket in half for faster cooling. Fat is an insulator, so the meat will cool much quicker without it and since brisket is so thin cutting in half should be sufficient.

Place the pan on the cooling rack in the walk-in and set a timer for **two** hours.

When the timer goes off, temp the meat and make sure it is below **70** degrees and record the value in the temperature log.

Now set the timer for **Four** hours and temp the meat again to make sure it is below **41** degrees and record the value in the temperature log.
