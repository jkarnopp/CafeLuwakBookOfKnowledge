# Steamed Milk

Pour the milk into the steaming container until it is about half full. Using the tip of the steaming wand right on the surface of the milk turn the steam on and slowly raise the wand keeping it at the surface to produce the foam. This is called stretching the milk. Once the container is filled with foam to about a half-inch to an inch below the rim put the steaming wand all the way into the cup, so the milk swirls as it is being heated. You want the foam to be made of extremely small bubbles, and this swirling action will break the bubbles down so you have a nice microfoam.  Bring the milk up to a temperature of 140 degrees, and turn the steam off and remove the wand from the container. Set the steamed milk aside and finish the rest of the drink. You want to steam the milk before espresso in espresso drinks because the steamed milk will hold its temperature better than the espresso, and espresso loses flavor as it cools. After pouring the shots, tap the milk container on the counter and swirl the milk before pouring over the shots.
