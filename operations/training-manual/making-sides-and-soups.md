# Making Sides and Soups

Like the meats our sides are all homemade and that is one of the things that keep customers coming back. One of the most important things with the sides especially is consistency. When we make a side item we want it to taste the same each time it is made. Customers will get wary of an item that doesn’t have a consistent taste and stop ordering it. 

**Training Steps:**

·         Cook it Slow

·         Chopping items

·         Boiled Pasta \(Al Dente\)
