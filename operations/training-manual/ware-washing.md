# Ware Washing

Years ago I worked at a hotel in Ann Arbor as a dishwasher, and I remember a reviewer from the newspaper being shown around the kitchen, and when he stopped at my area he said "It doesn’t matter how good the food is that a restaurant serves. If the plates aren’t clean the meal is over". I probably quoted him wrong, but it really is true that no one wants to eat off of dirty dishes or drink out of cloudy glasses. It is very important to make sure that items going through the dishwasher come out clean and without any debris on them.    

**Training Steps:**

·         The different racks

·         Soak and Scrub the glass

·         Soak and double wash silverware

·         The dishwasher is really a sanitizer, so you really need to spray items clean first.

·         Using three sinks if the dishwasher fails.

·         Cleaning and sanitizing the cutting boards.

·         Staking for drying.

·         Peeling the day dots off.
