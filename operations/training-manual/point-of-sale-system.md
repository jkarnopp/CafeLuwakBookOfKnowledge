# Point of Sale System

If you have never used a touch screen point of sale system before, it can take a little get used to. Sometimes the most difficult thing can be just figuring out what category something is under. One of the easiest ways to get used to this is to practice taking orders in training mode.  

**Entering Order Types**

The first piece of information you need when entering an order is whether it is for dine in, to go, pickup, or delivery.
