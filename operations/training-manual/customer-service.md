# Customer Service

Customer service is by far the most important aspect of this business. Without our customers, we have no business. The goal with every customer is to treat them the way you would want to be treated if you were on the other side of the counter. Be pleasant, respectful, and courteous. Since every employee gets a portion of the tips, it is important that we all work together to make sure the customer is taken care of properly. The better service we provide, the higher the tips and more customers returning which means even more tips in the future.

So what does it take to provide good customer service? When dealing with customers think of the things below:

**Find out what the customer wants.**

The customer is here because they want something. Whether it is a full meal, a coffee drink or an ice cream cone, you should make sure that you are paying attention to everything the customer needs. Make suggestions, ask questions, and don't walk away until you know they have completed their request.

**Communicate, communicate, and communicate.**

There is nothing more offensive to a customer than being ignored. When a customer comes in the door, they really just want to be acknowledged. Even if you are busy dealing with other things, looking at the customer and letting them know that you will be with them in a minute will totally set the tone for their visit.  Even if their service is slower than normal, typically they won't mind as long as the employees are paying attention to them.

**Look at the people!**

The first cook I had used to say this all day long. Whenever we would get caught up after a rush, she would send someone out to look at the people. In other words, go out and see what people need.

·         Check if anyone needs refills on drinks

·         Clear empty plates so customers can talk more comfortably

·         Clean empty tables and wipe them down, so new customers can sit where they want.

·         Ask the customers how their food was.

**Do the extra little things.**

When it is slow, there is always the temptation to just chat with the other employees and wait for customers to come up and ask for something. If you have the time though, you are much more likely to improve the tips if you do the extra little things that make a customer feel special.

·         If it is slow offer to take a family's order at their table.

·         When you see children, see if they would like a balloon \(always ask the parents to make sure it is okay\)

·         Ask how their meal was and suggest dessert.

**Keep it positive!!!**

The last thing a customer wants to hear is employees complaining and making nasty comments about people. Do not ever talk about a customer when there are customers in the place. Even if you aren’t talking about the customers who are here, they will assume that you will talk about them as soon as they leave and probably won’t come back. Do not complain about other employees or other shifts. Even when you are in the kitchen, people in the back dining room can hear everything you are saying. People go out to eat to get away from the drama in their lives. They really do not want to be involved in yours. Leave your problems at home and always put on a happy face to the customer.

·         Don't talk negatively about customers.

·         Don’t talk negatively about employees or shifts.

·         Leave personal problems at home.

**Problem Resolution**

No matter what you do, there will be days when things go wrong and a customer gets upset. No one is perfect and the universe has a tendency to exploit any weakness we as humans have on a daily basis. Most customers who get upset will vent their frustrations then calm down to a point where a rational discussion can take place. While they are venting, just try to understand why they are upset, and when they are ready to listen, be apologetic and try to come up with resolutions that make the customer feel like even though there was something wrong, we cared and did what we could to make it right. The best approach is to keep an eye on customers. You can usually tell when someone is getting agitated by their body language. If a customer is waiting too long for their food, go up and let them know the status, explain if there was a large delivery order or if we are short staffed. Offer them a free ice cream if you think it will help. If you communicate with them before they get upset, they will usually feel like you have done the best you could. 

There are always going to be people who get upset and have to take it out on someone, and no matter what you say they aren’t going to be happy. In these cases, the best thing to do is just be patient and listen to their concerns, offer solutions, and don’t get angry. If you start arguing back with them, they will only ask to see the manager and try to get you fired.

·         Watch body language and try to preempt problem situations.

·         Let people know the status of their order and apologize for the delay.

·         Try to explain why an order is taking too long before a customer asks why it is taking so long.

·         If someone feels like you have wasted their time, try to offer them a free ice cream or even a gift certificate for their next meal. Always remember we need repeat customers!!!
