# Sandwich Making

Sandwich making is one of the most difficult parts of the job. This is where you need to be fast, accurate, and have an almost gut feeling of how to prioritize orders. During a rush you could have a whole row of tickets, and this is one of the few areas where the first in first out rule doesn’t always apply. Lots of times you want to get a To Go order out before you start on a table of 6 people, or you may need to push two sandwiches in front of a large delivery. Doing well at making sandwiches really means doing well at managing the flow to meet the expectations of the customers. Of course to do this you really do have to be fast at making sandwiches and that does take some practice and memorization.
