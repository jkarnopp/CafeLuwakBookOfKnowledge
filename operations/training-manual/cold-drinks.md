# Cold Drinks

There really isn't much to say about the cold drinks other than the majority is fountain drinks. If you are running the cash register when someone orders a fountain drink with their meal, you should get their drinks for them before you wait on the next customer. This way the middle person doesn’t have to worry about it when they take out their meal. If they order a smoothie or a coffee drink the ticket should be place on the back counter and the middle person or sandwich maker should be notified so they know a drink has to go out the with the meal. Once the line goes down, you should check to see if anyone has made the drinks and if not make them and get them to the customer as quickly as possible.
