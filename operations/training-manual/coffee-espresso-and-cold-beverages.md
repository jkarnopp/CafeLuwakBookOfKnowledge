# Coffee, Espresso, and Cold Beverages

The coffee side of the business is very important and has to be done right. When you charge several dollars for an espresso drink, the customer has expectations that need to be met. As an employee, you must understand the complexities of the drink and what makes a good cappuccino, and what makes a bad one. The items below will describe portions of the training that you should go through with either me or another employee to understand the proper way of making espresso drinks, coffee, and cold beverages. In the sections below you will learn how we portion our drinks, make them, and clean the equipment. After going through this section with another employee, manager, or me, you will get a signature at the end stating that you have been shown how to operate this station. I tend to hire people who really enjoy coffee, so this part of the training is usually the most enjoyable.

**Brewed Coffee**

We typically have three kinds of coffee brewed at all times. Our house blend, which is a Mocha Java blend made from Ethiopian and Sumatran coffee beans. The French Roast which is a blend that is specially designed for darker roasting and we also use it for our espresso drink. Finally, we have decaf which is more of a mild traditional coffee. All of our coffees are fair trade and organic. The Decaf coffee is decaffeinated through what is called a Swiss water process. This is a non-chemical process that removes the caffeine with a hot water process. Unfortunately, it does remove some of the taste. We are currently looking into finding a decaf that has gone through a mountain water process that uses cold water, but we haven't found a good solution yet.

**Training Steps**

·         Portioning - Coffee portions are done on the scale in the kitchen and each portion is weighed to .17 lbs. \(we also use a 3 gallon pot for festivals and special tastings. There is a large filter used for these and they portioned at .49 lbs\)

·         Grinding - The regular coffee is ground through the black grinder set to auto drip.

·         Brewing - Ground coffee is put into the basket, verify the half pot is selected, and press the brew a button.

·         Cleaning - Airpots are dumped and rinsed every night, and scrubbed with cafeza every Sunday.

·         The basket should also be soaked and scrubbed with cafeiza every Sunday

·         Cleaning beans should be run through the grinder on Sundays.

·         Portioning the retail coffee should be done as needed and the portions are 1.05 lb for the 1lb bag, and .55 for the half pound bag. The .05 extra covers the weight of the bag.

**Espresso**

Espresso drinks are probably the most complicated thing to do right. When it is done right and you make the perfect drink, customers will remember and come back especially if they see you behind the counter. Lattes and Cappuccino's can also be a lot of fun and allow you to be creative. Latte art is something that really sets the true barista apart from the average espresso operator. One of the fringe benefits of working here, is that you are welcome to make yourself an espresso drink each day whether you are working or not. I want people to be able to practice making these drinks right.

**Training Steps**

·         Grinding the espresso - we grind all espresso to order, so it is as fresh as possible.

·         Portioning and tamping the grind - The portions vary based on the different size portafilter. The tamping method is also different for each.

·         Brewing the shot - The shot should take between 20 and 30 seconds to brew and should have at least 1/4 inch of crema on the top.

·         Adjusting the grind - If the brew time and the crema are not correct then the grind might need to be adjusted. You adjust the grind based on how the shot is brewed. You will be shown this on each grinder.

·         Foaming the milk - This is probably hardest part to do right. The process is almost more of an art because things like temperature and humidity can make a difference on how the milk foams. Also the amount of foam is different based on the type of drink.

·         Milk amounts and types - We have whole, skim, and soy for milk options. We can also mix whole and skim to get something close to 2%. You always want to add enough fresh milk, so that you have at least 50% fresh.

·         Thermometer and temps - use of the thermometer to get the proper temps without scalding. Lower temps for children.

·         Spooning the milk - using a spoon to hold back the milk for a latte or control the amount of foam flow for a cappuccino.

·         Milk Crema Mixture. The most importing part of a milk based espresso drink is making sure the foam and the crema from the espresso are mixed and it isn’t all white milk foam on the top

·         Pour control and Art Introduction - The method of using the way you pour the drink to control how much foam comes out and also how you can use the pitcher to create patterns on the top.

·         Drink Types -

o   Cappuccino - Espresso, 1/2 milk, 1/2 foam

o   Latte - Espresso, Milk, 1/4" to 1/2" foam on top.

o   Mocha - Latte with mocha syrup.

o   Flavored Latte - Most popular would be the caramel latte, but they are all derivatives of the latte and have a flavor.

o   Macchiato - Some people will order a macchiato and assume that it will be a caramel latte the way Starbucks does it others will want a real macchiato which is a shot of espresso with a dollop of foam on the top

o   Americano - Espresso with hot water added to bring it to the strength of an American coffee.

o   Café Au Le - This is really the cheep mans latte. It is made with regular coffee and steamed milk in a 50/50 mix.

o   Breve - This is a latte made with half and half instead of milk.

o   Chai Latte - This is made with Chai Tea concentrate and steamed milk just like a latte.

o   Steamer - Steamed milk and flavor. \(i.e. Hot chocolate\)

o   Iced Lattes and flavored drinks

o   Luwak Frap for Summer.

·         Cleaning the brew heads - Using the brush to clean the heads. Backflushing the heads. Backflushing with cafeza every Sunday.

·         Cleaning the drain tray - removing the drain tray and cleaning it.

·         Running the clean beans through the grinder - this should be done on Sundays.

·         Cleaning portafilters - Should soak in cafeza every Sunday.

·         Treating the water softener. Adding salt to the water softener should be done the first Sunday of every month. \(this is advanced training\)
