# Stocking and Storage

Putting away stock properly is extremely important. The one thing to always remember with stocking is F.I.F.O. which stands first in first out. The idea is that you always want to use the oldest item first. If you use the newest, the older items just keep getting older until they are unusable. This is obviously more important for perishables like vegetables and meats, but it is still important for canned goods and items with long shelf lives.     

**Training Steps:**

·         The stock areas \(music room, dry store, basement\)

·         Columns!!!

·         Rotation

·         Pulling items out of boxes.

·         The floor is not storage.
