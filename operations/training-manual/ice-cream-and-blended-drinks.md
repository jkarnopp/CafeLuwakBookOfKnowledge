# Ice Cream and Blended Drinks

The ice cream part of the business can be the craziest area to work especially during festivals, car shows, and cruise nights. The majority of people who come in will just want a scoop of ice cream in either a cone or a bowl. Other than portion sizes, the scoops are pretty simple. The shakes and sundaes are where things get a little more complicated, but even so none of it is brain surgery. The number one rule is: what would you expect if you were the customer? There isn’t much you can to screw up the ice cream, so presentation is the most important aspect of preparing these items.
