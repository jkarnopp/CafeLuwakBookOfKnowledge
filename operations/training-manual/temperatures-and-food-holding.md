# Temperatures and Food Holding

Keeping track of temperatures is important for the safety of our guests as well as keeping track of the equipment. Food that isn’t stored at the right temperature grows bacteria at an exponential rate and after 4 to 6 hours becomes unsafe to eat. Proper tracking will also let us keep an eye on things and save food before it thaws and get equipment fixed before it is a real emergency.       

**Training Steps:**

·         Temperature for Cold holding

·         Temperature for hot holding.

·         Temperature Sheet for tracking

·         Thermometers IR and Probe Based

·         Thermometer Calibration
