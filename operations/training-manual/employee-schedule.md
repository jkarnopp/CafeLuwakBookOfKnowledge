# Employee Schedule

I try to get the schedule posted by Thursday for the following week. I also try to get the schedule as fixed as possible, so that it doesn’t change much from week to week. In the summer this is harder because employees are taking vacations, but even so most employees will have pretty set days. After every semester break, we go through several weeks of flux as everyone’s school schedule changes, but eventually, it all settles down.

**Changes to Schedule**

If you need a day off, I prefer that employees try to work it out with other employees to get the day covered. Then just mark it on the schedule, and that is really all I need to be involved. If you can't find someone to cover your shift, let me know and I am sure we can work something out.

For Vacations or long weekends, try to find people to cover, and let me know what shifts they will work, and I will print them on the schedule. Also, I will need to know about the vacation so I can make sure everything is covered.

If you are sick, it is better that you stay home, but please try to call as soon as you can to let us know, so we can try to find someone to cover for you.

If you need a permanent schedule change due to other conflicts like school, fill out the availability form, and I will work on reworking your schedule. Schedule priority is determined by performance, seniority, and availability. I try to work as hard as I can to provide the shifts and desired number of hours that each employee requests, but sometimes when schedules and available changes, there isn’t enough room to fit the hours in. Usually, this still works out since employees will know that someone wants more hours, and they will call them when they need time off.
