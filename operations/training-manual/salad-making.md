# Salad Making

Salads are made in the back kitchen for right now. I am hoping to add an extension to the sandwich table eventually so we can make them up front, but for now we use the kitchen. We have four standard salads, Garden, Chef, Greek, and Caesar. In the future we may add more salads.    

**Training Steps:**

·         The salad build list.

·         Salad tray and vegetable location

·         Even in the back gloves must be used for ready to eat foods.

·         Meats and cheeses

·         Dressings

·         Dressing mixed in for Caesar.

·         To go v.s. Dine in.
