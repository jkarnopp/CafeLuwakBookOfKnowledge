# Sanitation and Safety

Sanitation is probably the number one responsibility of everyone who works in a restaurant. Almost all cases of food born illness are caused by poor sanitation and cross contamination of ready to eat and raw food items. Our number one goal has to always be to keep our customers safe and healthy. This is the one area where management has no patience for laziness. Any employee who puts the customer's health and safety at risk because they don’t care will be terminated immediately.
