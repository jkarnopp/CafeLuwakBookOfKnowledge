# Mid Section - Food Delivery

The mid section of the restaurant is kind of a floating position. In the middle of a sandwich rush the person handling the mid section will keep and eye on sandwiches on the grill, take them off and plate them, and take the order out or wrap them and bag them for delivery, pickup, or to go orders. One of the most important aspects of this position is the verification of the order. This is our last chance to catch mistakes before they get out to the customer. This is critically important for a delivery order where a mistake will most likely mean an additional trip to the customer’s location. The person in the position is also the primary person to follow up with the customer, get refills, and assist with the front section when needed. Often the person in this position will be watching a sandwich and scooping ice cream at the same time.   

**Training Steps:**

·         Cutting Sandwiches \(Veggie vs. Meat knives\)

·         Checking Sandwiches \(cheese melted? Lettuce Added?, etc…\)

·         Plating food

·         Wrapping sandwiches

·         Packing deliveries \(always use insulated bag\)

·         Cleaning Board and knives \(always after tuna and before leaving the station\)
