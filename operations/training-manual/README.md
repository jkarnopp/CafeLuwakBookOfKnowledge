# Training Manual

This training manual came about after three years of writing procedures, posting signs, and trying to do training by example. This worked okay for a couple of years because I had the same employee train everyone, but when that employee left the company, each new employee started learning things a different way, and our consistency started to really go downhill. In the food service business, consistency is extremely important, and training our employees to all do things the same way will keep our customers coming back and being happy because they get the products and services they are expecting.

As you go through this manual feel free to take notes and offer suggestions. I consider my employees my greatest resource, so if you think you have a better idea of how to do something, please let me know. This company is constantly evolving, and all of our employees leave their mark on the place in one way or another.
