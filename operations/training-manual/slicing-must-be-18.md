# Slicing \(Must be 18\)

Slicing is probably one of the most important items for the business. The quality of the products and the food costs are probably most determined by slicing properly. Also the order is important for our vegetarian customers.

**Training Steps:**

·         Slicing Order

o   Veggies First

o   Onions the last of the veggies

o   Wipe down slicer to remove onion before going to next item. Onions affect the taste and are a popular allergen.

o   Slice Cheeses next.

o   Finally Slice Meet

·         Thicknesses for veggies

·         Thicknesses for Cheese

·         Thicknesses for Meat

·         Cutting against the grain for meats.  

·         Cleaning the slicer

o    First and foremost, unplug the slicer while cleaning it.

o    With the guard on the slicer, clean the inside parts of the blade with hot soapy water and a green pad, now clean the outside part of the blade. Wipe the blade with a damp cloth to remove excess water and soap.

o    Remove the carriage that holds the item being sliced. You do not need to completely unscrew the knob… just enough to release it.

o    Unscrew the shaft that holds the faceplate guard on the slicer blade.  Carefully remove the guard. Hold the blade with a damp cloth while cleaning the inner part.  Once you have cleaned the blade take the guard and carriage to the pot sink.

o    Clean both with hot soapy water.  Dry and put them back on the slicer right away.

·         Sharpening the Slicer

o    Remove the protective cover over the sharpening stones on top of the slicer.

o    Loosen the knob to allow the stones to come up to the blade

o    Drop the stones down in between the blade and lock the knob back in place.

o    Plug the slicer in, turn the slicer on, and engage both sharpening stones with light pressure until they turn on the slicing blade.

o    Vary the pressure medium to light. Both sharpening wheels should be turning.

o    Do this for approximately 1 ½ min. Turn the slicer off; loosen the knob to allow the stones to come back up to the original position. Put the protective cover back on, and be sure that all is secured in place.

o    Clean sharpening debris off of the blade guard, carriage, and underneath the slicer.
