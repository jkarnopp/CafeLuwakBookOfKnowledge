# Roasting Meats

One of the things that sets us apart from the rest of the competition is the fact that we cook a lot of our meats here. Our goal is always to use the highest quality ingredients. Cooking the meats we use is not difficult, but it does require patience and attention to detail. If items aren't trimmed properly or cooked slowly and temped often, we will incur a lot of cost and waste.

**Training Steps:**

·         Go over the types of meats we roast

·         Deboning the Turkeys

·         Spicing and wrapping turkeys

·         Spicing roast beef

·         Spicing BBQ Beef

·         Spicing Corned Beef

·         Boiling the Corned beef.

·         Roasting all the meats

·         Trimming the roast beef. Boiling the extra turkey for salad and soups.
